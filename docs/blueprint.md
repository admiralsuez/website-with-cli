# **App Name**: CLI Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Project Display: Display the list of projects with relevant information like title, description, and link to the live project or repository.
- Customization Tool: A simple UI that acts as tool for creating, editing, and customizing the project showcase information. It saves all changes in memory.
- Theme Customization: Admin panel to customize the color scheme and fonts of the website.
- Navigation: A clear navigation system that mimics CLI commands to navigate through different sections of the portfolio.
- Interactive Elements: Add interactive elements such as animated text or interactive command prompts to enhance the terminal-like feel.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F) to emulate a terminal background, lending a professional and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Almost-black (#1A1A1A), subtly distinct from the primary to ease eye strain.
- Accent color: Lime green (#32CD32) as the primary text color and cursor to maintain the classic terminal look but with a modern twist. Avoid excessive usage to maintain clarity.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel. Use it for the headers and smaller body text.
- Use simple line icons to represent different sections or actions, maintaining a minimalist and clean design. Icons should be monochromatic, in the accent color.
- Design the layout to resemble a terminal window, with a header, main content area, and a command input line. Maintain clear, consistent spacing.
- Subtle animations such as a blinking cursor or smooth transitions between sections to enhance the terminal-like experience without compromising usability.
